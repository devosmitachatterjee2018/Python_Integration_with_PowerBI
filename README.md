# Python_with_PowerBI

## Responsibilities
- Propose a states and transitions model for describing the traffic scenarios.
- Describe the surrounding traffic objects in the model by occupation grids of size 3x3 cells, one grid for each type of traffic object. The grids are translated into binary matrices where 1 denotes the occupation of nearby traffic object. Also attributes such as the vehicleâ€™s speed and angular movement are used.
- Evaluate the model by analysing sequences of states computed from real traffic data provided by Viscando AB.
- Use clustering methods, such as K-means and DBSCAN to distinguish different scenarios represented by the model.
